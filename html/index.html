    Japanese fusion with Katsu means hand-formed, miso seasoned, Japanese breaded, American sized, and American fried goodness.  
    Take a bite, crunch into the golden brown crisp, and experience real tenderness.  That's Katsu.  The love, and work behind the scenes.  
    That's the Katsu team. You'll find the items on our menu deliver the taste of Japan, with the restaurant roots of Seattle.
